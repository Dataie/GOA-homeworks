           <h1><strong>Khinkali</strong></h1>
           <p>
                <strong><em>Khinkali</em></strong> is a traditional Georgian dumpling
                filled with minced meat, herbs, and spices. 
                Typically made with beef, pork, or lamb, 
                it’s known for its distinctive twisted top 
                and juicy filling. Khinkali is usually boiled 
                and eaten by hand, with the top being discarded 
                after enjoying the rest of the dumpling. It's a 
                popular dish in Georgia, especially in the mountainous regions.
